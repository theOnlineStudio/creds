			<p>To create a suite of banners to help launch Google’s new software. The deliverables included 60 standard banners, rich media banners (including an interactive masthead which took pictures of the user and produced an animated gif based on the photo’s taken) and expandable mobile banners.</p>

			<h4 class="projectManagement">Project Management + </h4>
			<p>Managed the agency by creating priority orders, advising on deliverables, liaising with sites and adservers, collating amends then applying them across all relevant formats to ensure consistency.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4 class="development">Development + </h4>
			<p>The client had reservations about building the interactive masthead within a very short timeframe and thought about pulling the execution.  We then built it in time, within budget and worked perfectly.</p>
