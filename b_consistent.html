		<h3>...in getting to know you</h3>
		<p>Your production resource should simplify the production stage of the process, not complicate it. With a permanent, consistent workforce, our project managers and developers will be familiar with your process, your clientâ€™s brand and their idiosyncrasies, and we will still be here for any subsequent updates</p>
